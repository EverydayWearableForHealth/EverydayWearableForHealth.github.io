    Research on personalized and accessible healthcare in HCI. (a) Interactive design and digital fabrication of custom hand exercisers using 3D printing. (b) Customized sensing sleeve for rehabilitation monitoring and pneumatic actuators for active feedback during therapy. (c) Accessible electrical impedance interfaces with customized 3D-printed holders and a laser-cut bandage for real-time muscle and tendon tracking. (d) An Internet-of-Things approach that uses jewelry as sensors, streaming data to a smartphone app via Bluetooth for real-time physiological monitoring. (e) All-day, energy-efficient smart glasses that use audio-driven image capture to support human memory enhancement. (f) A smartwatch that empowers users to define personalized actions and receive just-in-time interventions.

Wearable health technologies are rapidly shifting care from clinical settings into daily life, enabling continuous and personalized monitoring through devices embedded in daily objects such as garments, watches, jewelry, and bandages. This transformation makes healthcare more accessible and proactive, but also raises challenges of personalization, scalability, and inclusivity. This workshop will connect researchers, designers, engineers, and clinicians to explore opportunities and challenges in developing low-cost, adaptive, and user centered healthcare wearables. We will explore advances from fabrication and sensing to data analysis and clinical integration. Through talks and collaborative discussions, our aim is to **answer key research questions, strengthen cross-disciplinary connections, and build a community that shapes the future of personalized healthcare in HCI**. -->

<!-- Human bodies are almost always in contact with soft materials like clothing, for warmth, protection, self-expression, etc. Recent advancements in intelligent soft wearables have augmented these on-body soft objects with computational functions and intelligence with little compromise on the softness and comforts of wearables, allowing prolonged wear. These innovations, which combine advanced soft sensor design, fabrication, and computational power, offer unprecedented opportunities to improve our health, productivity, and overall well-being with monitoring and assistive capabilities. However, the inherent physical properties of soft materials present unique challenges in achieving practical interactions. The complexity of intelligent soft wearables, multiplexing intricate designs, soft materials, flexible electronics, advanced signal processing algorithms, and machine learning models, necessitates collaborative efforts from experts across diverse domains. This workshop aims to **bring together interested researchers and practitioners across relevant domains to discuss the challenges and opportunities of intelligent soft wearables**. -->
