We invite participants who are experienced in and/or interested in intelligent soft wearables. We call for three kinds of contributions:
* **Interactive Demos** to be showcased during the worshop's talk & demo session: up-to-2-page submission,
* **Experience/Reflection Reports** to be presented during the worshop talk session: up-to-4-page submission, and
* **Posters** to be presented during the worshop talk & demo session: up-to-4-page submission.


**Workshop participation is open to everyone**, if the venue space allows, without submitting a demo/report/poster.

### Important Dates
<!-- * [x] **~~6/26/25~~ 7/3/25 AoE**: Submission Deadline -->
* [ ] **2/27/26 AoE**: Submission Deadline
* [ ] **3/13/26 AoE**: Decision Notification
* [ ] **3/20/26 AoE**: Deadline for Camera-Ready Versions to be Included in ACM DL 
* [ ] **TBD**: Day of the Workshop 

### Topics of Interest
Submissions areas of interest include (but are not limited to):
* Human-centered design, accessibility, and inclusivity in health wearables
* Design and fabrication of comfortable, unobtrusive everyday health wearables
* Personalization pipelines spanning design, fabrication, and deployment
* Accessible computational design and digital fabrication toolkits for health wearables
* Sustainable materials, manufacturing, and lifecycle-aware health wearable design
* Multimodal sensing and sensor fusion for continuous health monitoring
* Multimodal AI for continuous health sensing (e.g., motion, biosignals, context)
* AI- and ML-driven methods for interpreting everyday wearable health data
* Adaptive and personalized AI models for long-term health monitoring
* On-device and edge intelligence for low-power, real-time health inference
* Foundation models and large language models for wearable health data
* Large-scale, longitudinal datasets and benchmarks for wearable health research
* Privacy-preserving learning, federated models, and ethical data governance
* Integration of wearable systems with digital health ecosystems and clinical workflows

### Preparing for the Submission
All submissions must be formatted using the **ACM double-column CHI 2026 Proceedings** template.
Participants should submit their position papers via email to **[everydaywearablesforhealth@gmail.com](mailto:everydaywearablesforhealth@gmail.com)**, with the subject line **[Workshop Submission]**.

### Review Process
Workshop submissions undergo single-blind review by 2 reviewers who are organizers of the workshop.

### Upon Accpetance
Authors of the accepted submissions can choose to have their submissions included in the ACM Digital Library as supplemental proceedings of the conference.

### During the Workshop
All accepted submissions will be presented/showcased during the workshop.
